faq:
    question1: What's NinjaTooken?
    reponse1: |
        NinjaTooken is a ninja playable FPS multiplayer games.
        Nay, Ninja Tooken is THE only ninja FPS.
        Inspired by manga, NinjaTooken will put yourself in the shoes of a ninja, that you can evolve according to your desires. Classes, weapons, skills, abilities, you can choose your way.
        Playable directly from your favorite browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Christopher Columbus, Safari, and even Internet Explorer), NinjaTooken is in full 3D and works with most computers (mine is 5 years old and it's ok).
    question2: Why subscribing?
    reponse2: |
        You can play without subscribing, but what you've done will not be saved.
    question3: Do we have to pay for playing?
    reponse3: |
        NO, absolutely not! Ninja Tooken is a FREE game, and it is just necessary to register (but that is also free)! We do not obviously accept the donations... To pay the servers of Ninja Tooken, we are using the advertising on the site.<br>
        - Sure, today it is free, but in a month we will have to pay, it is the Global Financial Crisis, isn't it ?<br>
        - But I have already said that ! Ninja Tooken is free and will stay free for ever! No worries about this, so stop annoying me !
    question4: Who are you, and why this game?
    reponse4: |
        We are a team of passionate persons: students, professionals, or simple newbies !<br>
        This game allows to express our skills, to develop them, but also and especially to please us.
    question5: When can we have the next versions?
    reponse5: |
        Unfortunately the time is what gives out: we work during our spare time without schedule and above all for the pleasure.<br>
        And as the creation of a video game takes a lot of time, it is impossible to us to give another answer than: "When it's done" !
    question6: What can I do to help you?
    reponse6: |
       It's very easy: speak about Ninja Tooken around you! In your MSN nickname, on your site, your blog, facebook, Twitter... Even a small adress! That's it. It is perfect for a partner link, for MSN or facebook. As you like it!
    question7: How to change the character name, or to delete my account?
    reponse7: |
        Once your account is created, you can change up to five times your nickname (and switch between each). All nicks that you use will be listed in your profile!<br>
        To delete your account, you just have to go to your <a href="%urlParametre%">parameters</a> and to click the button "deletion" which is at the bottom of the page. Take care, the deletion is definitive and your character cannot be given back.
    question8: Why I have a blank page and then nothing?
    reponse8: |
        First look if you have correctly installed the plugin unity3D available <a href="http://unity3d.com/webplayer/" target="_blank">here</a> (the installation is fast and does not require to reboot the browser).<br>
        Then verify that you can indeed see the <a href="http://unity3d.com/gallery/live-demos/index.html#tropical-paradise" target="_blank">Unity3d's demo</a>.<br>
        If yes, goes on <a href="http://www.m2h.nl/files/HWstats.html" target="_blank">this page</a>, then copy and paste the contents in the forum "<a href="%oldForum%?ID=65">Improvement and Bug</a>". Try to be precise in the description of your problem, and before posting look if somebody has already had the same problem. We shall can help you,so that you can join us in the game !<br>
        Otherwise, verify that the drivers of your graphics board are indeed updated, or try to go on the game with another browser!
    question9: The game is loading then suddenly stop before 100%, What can I do?
    reponse9: |
        If the game doesn't load completely, it is because your connection had a sudden network disconnetion during the load. There is currently, no automatic resuming of the download. To resume the load of the game and be able to play correctly, you just have to empty the <a href="http://www.libellules.ch/support/cache.php" target="_blank">cache storage of your browser</a> and <a href="http://webplayer.unity3d.com/setup/" target="_blank">of Unity</a>, and then to refresh the page. Have a lot of fun !
    question10: Why I do not manage to join a game?
    reponse10: |

        <span>NinjaTooken uses PhotonNetwork Cloud for multiplayer. There are several scenarios where you may have a problem :</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span>a firewall may be the case, then you only have to authorize the connection request from Photon</span></li>
            <li><span>anti-virus can also block connections : try to disableit during connection... if you can connect a bit of setup is also required (inquire into the FAQ of your antivirus)</span></li>
            <li><span>the problem may also come from your router or proxy...</span></li>
        </ul>
        Access to the control panel of the router. A fast research on Internet on the model of your router should give you the informations for this stage and the following ones.<br>
        Activate the mode DMZ (or "demilitarized zone"). Try to reboot Ninja Tooken, and it should work! If you cannot connect in the other games again, then it is not a problem of router: So it's useless to try the other stages, and go directly to the next part.<br>
        Desactivate the DMZ mode, then verifies if the mode UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is activated, to allow the automatic rerouting of the ports. It is indeed necessary to avoid leaving the router without the DMZ mode, because you become a pray with some internet attacks.<br>
        If the DMZ mode works, but not the UpnP mode, the last solution is to add yourself The rerouting of port <strong>5055</strong> UDP (adding ports 5056 UDP and TCP in 4520/4530/4531/843 can help if the connection does not work best). You can use Port Map if you are on the X operating system.
    question11: Why I do not manage to connect in my account?
    reponse11: |
        <span>Several problems can prevent you from connecting correctly :</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span>You have not validated your user account yet: an e-mail must be sent to you containing a link of validation. Click it, and connect!</span></li>
            <li><span>If you forgot your password, you just have to click the link at the top of page "forgotten password?", a new password will be sent to you with an e-mail.</span></li>
            <li><span>Your nickname or your password contains characters which aren't Latin (you wanted to show off by writing in Japanese?). To correct the problem, <a href="%urlContact%" title="contact us">contact us</a>!</span></li>
            <li><span>The server is overloaded: no miracles, you have to wait!</span></li>
        </ul>
    question12: The game is lagging, what can I do ?
    reponse12: |
        The game can slow down to you but not for the other players (who will see you moving in a hatched way). It is generally due to a problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping" target="_blank">ping</a> (too high).<br>
        To verify your ping, you can go at : <a href="http://ping.eu/ping/" target="_blank">http://ping.eu/ping/</a> and type in the url of the PhotonCloud Service : app.exitgamescloud.com<br>
        A correct ping is on average below 20ms. If yours is above, contact your Internet Service Provider.<br>
        Notice that the ping has no relation with your speed of download, which can be the second problem of lagging: Be sure that you download nothing when you play !
    question13: The game is slowing down, what can I do ?
    reponse13: |
        If the game is slowing down, you can decrease the graphic quality of the game in the menu: "options" then "graphs".<br>
        More information is available in <a href="%urlManuel%#parametrage-video" title="parameter setting of the video and the sound">the textbook of the ninja: "parameter setting of the video and the sound"</a>.<br>
        You can also reduce the resolution to improve system performance in "full screen".
    question14: When i'm playing, the mouse does not answer any more, what can I do?
    reponse14: |
        There is for the current version of Unity3D (a graphic engine used for NinjaTooken) a bug preventing the mouse from working correctly with the Internet Explorer browser. This bug can occur but not necessarily always.<br>
        If it's happening, you can switch your browser to an another one.

        nom: To begin...
        sousPartie1:
            nom: General Description
            description: |
                Ninja Tooken transports you into a universe where ninjas are merciless. The game’s purpose? Kill them ALL !!<br><br>
                To begin, <a href="%urlRegister%">create your account</a>. Then, choose your ninja class: Katon (the fire), Suiton (the water), Futon (the wind), Doton (the earth), Raiton (the lightning).<br>
                Then, the principle is simple: the more you kill, the more you’ll gain experience.<br>
                These points will allow you to develop your ninja according to your class.<br><br>
                But be careful: every element has his worst enemy. For example, if you belong to Katon, distrust especially Suitons.
        sousPartie2:
            nom: Game control
            description: |
                Nothing’s easier than playing Ninja Tooken !!<br><br>
                Like most of FPS, you have to use the"W, A, S, D" keys to move.<br><br>
                You can also use Spacebar to jump (or right-click), "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" for weapons and "Q, E, R, F, T" for jutsus... But you can also change your weapons or jutsus by rolling the scroll wheel up and down. It's very usefull, because they are all (what a coincidence!) grouped together...<br><br>
                Of course if you don't like this arrangement, you can customize it in <a href="#parametrage-touche" title="game options">game options</a>.<br><br>
                Icing on the cake: you can also change mouse sensitivity in game options. Damn good, right ?

            description: |
                Two types of mission are available in the Ninja Tooken "Single Game" : Race and Murdering.<br>
                Complete these missions will allow you to improve the control of your ninja during moves and attacks, while makin' EXP !<br>
                To complete these missions, launch a single game, then press the "chat key" ("Enter" by default) , when you’re near the corresponding icons.<br>
                You can relaunch each mission as many time as you want !
            sousPartie1:
                nom: Race
                description: |
                    To complete these missions, you'll have to collect golden coins in a short time.<br>
                    The amount of EXP earned depends on the number of pieces to pick up and the remaining time.
            sousPartie2:
                nom: Murdering
                description: |
                    A ninja’s head is on contract! To achieve it, you will have to assassinate him on the map. If your target or another ninja kills you, the mission fails. If you exceed the time limitation, the mission fails.<br>
                    You already understood that you’ll have to show a true ninja instinct to complete this mission.
            sousPartie3:
                description: |
                    For each one of these missions, you’ll be helped by an indicator, which allows you to know the location of the nearest coin or the ninja to murder. In the up left corner, you’ll see a window containing updates about the mission type, the time left, and specific informations for each mission.
        sousPartie4:
            nom: Network Game
            description: |
                Five types of games are available at the creation of a network game :
            sousPartie1:
                nom: Standard game
                description: |
                    No time, no team, no flag: just Fight !<br>
                    Every connected player will have to fight for his survival with his own means, without help (comrades) and without time limit.
            sousPartie2:
                nom: Team game
                description: |
                    For this game, two teams are engaged in a merciless war! Every new player who connects joins the least numerous team.<br>
                    The enemies are in red, the allies in blue, and it’s not possible to kill an ally.
            sousPartie3:
                nom: Timed game
                description: |
                    You have 10 minutes to make the game yours. Then, the countdown is reset and a new round begins! No team, just enemies !
            sousPartie4:
                nom: Capture the sashimono
                description: |
                    On the playground two sashimonos (flags) are placed on two specific locations for each map. The objective is to bring the opponent flag to your own location. <br>
                     The first of the two teams that could capture a certain amount of times the enemy flag wins.
            sousPartie5:
                nom: Scroll mode
                description: |
                    The goal of this mode is to capture a scroll which is a single object on the map (and placed randomly), then survive for some time on a defined location to earn max 'experience! <br>
                    This mode is a mix of the "hunter" mode (not available in Ninja Tooken) and "capture the sashimono" while keeping specifics of Ninja Tooken.
    partie2:
        nom: My Ninja
        sousPartie1:
            nom: Life and Chakra
            description: |
                The life and the chakra are two very important elements for your ninja: if you don’t have any life points left, you’ll die. And if you have no more chakra points available, you can’t use jutsus anymore.<br>
                These two capacities can be increased with the points you gain at each level, meaning how many you put into it.<br>
                You can also recover the life or chakra lost during a battle, with the bonuses spread onto the map. The bonus "bowl of ramen" gives some life, and the bonus "Ying Yang" gives some chakra.<br>
                Besides, the chakra regenerates itself at a rate of 5 points per second.
        sousPartie2:
            nom: Experience
            description: |
                The experience can be gained by several means.<br>
                In <a href="#partie-solo" title="Play solo">Play Solo</a>, you gain some experience when you kill a ninja, but you can also gain it by succeeding the available missions.<br>
                In the Network mode, the experience results from the ninjas you kill and specifics of a mode. The higher the ninja’s level you’ve just knock down is, the more EXP you’ll get.<br>
                Then you must necessarily take risks, and challenge the best ninjas.<br>
                Once gained, this experience allows you to level up, and each level gives points of capacities and jutsus.<br>
                <br>
                You will find in the <a href="#partie-solo" title="beginners' guide">"beginners' guide"</a> all the information concerning the various manners to get some experience in Ninja Tooken !
                <h4>Dans</h4>
                <p>Once you reach the level 100, you will have the possibility from the "my ninja" menu to pass a dan (or rank). When you pass a dan, your level is recalculated based on your EXP surplus: Final XP = XP Total - 5,194,303 * dan <br>
                Thus, you have the opportunity to "start" the game at the lower levels while keeping your ninja. <br>
                <br>
                There are currently 15 dans.
        sousPartie3:
            nom: Capacities
            description: |
                The capacities are the base of your ninja. At each level up, you will gain three points to distribute according to your will and the way you want to develop your ninja. You want him to be stronger? faster? more tenacious? It's up to you !
            sousPartie1:
                nom: Strength
                description: |
                    The Strength acts on two aspects of your ninja: the stronger you are, the more powerful your weapons will be (but only weapons and not jutsus!).<br>
                    But this capacity does not only improve the damages, it also allows your ninja to throw kunais, shurikens, and other weapons farther.
            sousPartie2:
                nom: Speed
                description: |
                    The Speed allows your ninja to run faster. Do not forget that a good ninja is furtive and sneaky, with a fast attack and retreat.
            sousPartie3:
                nom: Life
                description: |
                    The life's gauge is directly proportional to the Life. By putting points into it, you will increase your maximum health points.
            sousPartie4:
                nom: Chakra
                description: |
                    The Chakra is working like the Life. The more you put in it, the bigger your chakra gauge will be.
        sousPartie4:
            nom: Jutsus
            description: |
                With jutsus, we're getting down to business !<br>
                A point will be given to you for every level up. You can place it into the jutsu you wish to develop, or in the one that you want to learn.<br>
                Unlike the capacities, you won’t have all the jutsus at the beginning of your adventure. They are only available according to your progresses and class. But do not worry, every jutsu point is removable at any time, allowing you to develop another ability.
            sousPartie1:
                nom: Types of jutsus
                description: |
                    Jutsus divides up into several categories. There are passive or active (manually activated) jutsus. There are attack and defense jutsus, and even movement ones. You can really specialize your ninja as you wish, and improve your strategy at its best.
        sousPartie5:
            nom: Generals Jutsus
            description: |
                Most of the jutsus are common to the five classes (Katon, Futon, Raiton, Doton, Suiton), the others are specific to certain classes. We shall see them later. Let's see now these general jutsus.
            sousPartie1:
                nom: New player protection
                description: |
                    This passive jutsu does not consume chakra. It's available to any player which is under the level 30. It limits to 20 points the damage received by a ninja with a level 60 or higher. <br>
                    No improvements! This jutsu disappears at level 31.
            sousPartie2:
                nom: Chakra Ball
                description: |
                    This distance attack is very simple, it allows you to throw a ball of chakra. This ball is not affected by the gravity, and thus can be sent from long distance while remaining very precise.<br>
                    Improvement according to the jutsu points affected: bigger, more powerful, but increased chakra consumption.
            sousPartie3:
                nom: Double Jump
                description: |
                    As its name indicates it, the double jump allows you to make a second jump following the first one (while in the air) to reach high zones. The double jump is a passive jutsu, it isn’t necessary to activate it; it doesn’t require any chakra.<br>
                    Improvement according to the jutsu points affected: higher jumps.
            sousPartie4:
                nom: Shield
                description: |
                    The shield allows you to reduce damage undergone. But this jutsus isn’t passive, it’s necessary to activate it, and it’s active only for a while.<br>
                    Improvement according to the jutsu points affected: lasts longer, higher damage reduction but increased chakra consumption.

                nom: Walk on walls
                description: |
                    This active jutsu allows you to walk on very steep slopes and vertical surfaces during a certain laps of time. By default, it is activated by pressing the « Ctrl » key. It consumes chakra at each release, but don’t worry, this very useful jutsu is economic.<br>
                    Improvement according to the jutsu points affected: lasts longer but increased chakra consumption.
            sousPartie6:
                nom: Sharpened steel
                description: |
                    This very ancient and secret technique allows you to instil the power of chakra in your cutting weapons, so as to increase significantly their sharpness. Sword, kunaï, shurikens, shadowshuriken fuma, and makibishis will become even fiercer, and their damages will be greatly magnified.<br>
                    To keep his attention to its maximum, the pointer is blacked out during the effect time of reinforced steel. The enemies will be warned of the danger by the presence of a dragon turning around your ninja.<br>
                    Improvement according to the chakra points affected: Lasts longer and does more damage but consumes more chakra.
            sousPartie7:
                nom: Explosion
                description: |
                    The explosion is the most powerful common jutsu. To call the elemental forces, a short incantation time is necessary, allowing your targets to escape the effect area. If it’s not the case, they will be caught in a sphere of chakra coming from your ninja. It’s highly inadvisable to stay in the effect area of an explosion! If you plan to use it, you must foresee a good dose of chakra because if the explosion is very powerful, it also consumes a high amount of chakra.<br>
                    Improvement according to the jutsu points affected: higher damages and diameter, but increased chakra consumption.
            sousPartie8:
                nom: Protective chakra
                description: |
                    Once it's activated, this new jutsu allows you to use your chakra gauge to prevent inflicted damages. Your life gauge is then extended to your chakra gauge: it does not regenerate your health points.<br>
                    A heart beat will warn you and the other ninjas that you've activated the jutsu. Your opponents will also see a chakra aura emanating from your body.<br>
                    This jutsu can be desactivated at will. It's automatically desactivated when your chakra gauge is empty, or when the time span is over.<br>
                    Improvement according to the chakra points affected: lasts longer but consumes more chakra.
            sousPartie9:
                nom: Kusanagi
                description: |
                    This legendary sword, which is the Japanese matching piece of the most famous sword "Excalibur", can only be handled by the most powerful ninjas.<br>
                    Once mastered, "Kusanagi" will reveal itself to be your biggest ally in hand-to-hand fights and a fear instrument for your preys! Indeed, every time you're activating this powerful relic, a very high-speed condensed chakra wave will be thrown right in front of you.<br>
                    Improvement according to the chakra points affected: spreads further (and thus becomes larger) and deals more damage but consumes more chakra.<br><br><br>
                    Now let's see specific's jutsu to each class...
        sousPartie6:

                        Improvement according to the jutsu points affected: The ninja is becoming less and less visible. The distance needed for being targeted with the shadow shuriken decreases!
                sousPartie2:
                    nom: Tornado
                    description: |
                        Release the power of the wind during a limited moment. From your ninja to the targeted zone, the tornado moves in spiral and deals big damages to all the enemies nearby.<br>
                        Improvement according to the jutsu points affected: bigger effect area and higher damages and range, but increased chakra consumption and invocation time.<br>
                        <strong>To use this jutsu, your ninja must be going berserk. It occurs when you’ve lost 50% of your maximum health points !</strong>

        sousPartie7:
            nom: Weapons
            description: |
                Weapons in Ninja Tooken are as important as jutsus, do not forget them !<br>
                <br>
                The damages dealt by weapons is obviously depending on the type of weapon, but also on the <a href="#aptitude" title="Capacities">strength</a> of your ninja (except for explosive kunaï and smoke).<br>
            sousPartie1:
                nom: Katana
                description: |
                    The katana is the unique hand-to-hand fight weapon. Being more difficult to use in the ninjas’ distant fights, it deals very important damages! If you have the opportunity to get closer to another ninja, a blow of katana in the spine will be the ideal to finish him/her in no time !
            sousPartie2:
                nom: Kunaï
                description: |
                    The kunai is one of the basic ninja weapons. You have a good package of it, so use them! If you don’t have any left, you can always gather new ones in the weapon boxes spread onto every map. The kunai is not thrown straight because of the gravity getting involved... In order to improve the kunai trajectoty and reach farther targets, it is necessary that you increase your ninja’s Strength.
            sousPartie3:
                nom: Explosive kunaï
                description: |
                    The explosive kunai is used in the same way as the standard kunai, but it explodes at the end of a rather short time, or in contact with the target. Do not stay nearby! You can pick up more explosive kunai in the specific boxes.
            sousPartie4:
                nom: Shuriken
                description: |
                    The shuriken is also a basic ninja weapon. Who has already seen a true ninja without shuriken? As the other long range weapons, the shuriken undergoes the gravity and then do not reach the far away enemies . The kunai is better than the shuriken on this point, because the shuriken has a smaller range. However you can throw more shurikens at a time, but it's dealing less damages than a kunai. It's up to you to see which one you prefer! As kunais, you can get more shurikens in the weapon boxes.
            sousPartie5:
                nom: Shadow shuriken
                description: |
                    The shadow shuriken is an enormous shuriken which never misses its target! This weapon is as powerful as the sword but with a long range. However, you’ll fin it in very limited quantity. Use it at the right time !
            sousPartie6:
                nom: Smoke bomb
                description: |
                    The smoke bomb isn’t really a weapon since it doesn’t inflict damages. It allows you to run away during a badly engaged battle, or gives you a short break by giving off a large cloud of smoke during a few seconds. Your alias is also hidden in the meantime. It’s up to you to take the best advantage of this “tactical” weapon.
            sousPartie7:
                nom: Makibishi
                description: |
                    A makibishi is an assembly of four nails. Sent by handful of six, they allow you to trap the area where they fall. By running after an enemy who has launched his makibishi, you take the risk to stick them into your feet (inducing damages) and to cut your speed by half during a few seconds. Makibishi remain on the map as long as nobody walks on them (or as long as the trapper doesn’t disconnect).
        sousPartie8:
            nom: Classes
            description: |
                As you certainly know if you have already started to play, the Ninja Tooken adventure begins with the choice of your class. This choice allows you to specialize in an element by unlocking very <a href="#jutsuClasse" title="jutsus">specifics jutsus</a>.<br>
                <span>Among these five classes you will find :</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="suiton">Suiton (the water wich has for enemy Doton),</span></li>
                    <li><span class="katon">Katon (the fire wich has for enemy Suiton),</span></li>
                    <li><span class="futon">Futon (the wind wich has for enemy Katon),</span></li>
                    <li><span class="raiton">Raiton (the lightning wich has for enemy Futon),</span></li>
                    <li><span class="doton">Doton (the earth wich has for enemy Raiton).</span></li>
                </ul>
            sousPartie1:
                nom: Principle of the oppositions of classes
                description: |
                    Each classes is dominant on another one. It means that a ninja will deal more damages to an opposite class ninja.<br>
                    For example a Suiton ninja will deal 10% more damage to a Katon ninja. But the ninja Katon will also make that rate of damage to a Futon ninja. Here is a graph illustrating the ascendancies :<br>
                    <br>
                    Do not forget that you can see the percentages of ninja of every class at the homepage bottom. Choose wisely your class according to the classes already present in the game. If there is 50% of Doton ninjas, you’d rather choose Raiton !<br>
                    <br><br>
                    As said in the introduction, each class have two specific jutsus. These jutsus are probably going to determine your class choice.
                description2: |
                    <strong>Suiton</strong> : Walk on water, Tsunami<br>
                    <strong>Futon</strong> : Invisibility, Tornado<br>
                    <strong>Katon</strong> : Fire defence, Phoenix<br>
                    <strong>Raiton</strong> : Multishot, Teleportation<br>
                    <strong>Doton</strong> : Metamorphosis, Thorns of rock<br>
                    <br>
