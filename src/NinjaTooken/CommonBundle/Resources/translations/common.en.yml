        Hi %username%,<br><br>
        Ninja Tooken just made the one giant leap of its history and is happy to announce the new version of its website!<br>
        In this brand new gem, you'll find, amongst other wicked things :<br> 
        &bull; a new clan management system with more display features and a cool ranking system,<br>
        &bull; a jutsu calculator that will give you more info on your powers, the impact of your raids and will help you master your ninja's skills,<br>
        &bull; the chance to own 5 different logins,<br>
        &bull; an improved display : wether you want to visit us on your pc, tablet or smartphone, the whole website will adjust to your device !<br>
        Also, just so you can benefit from an even better performance, we decided to host the website on a dedicated server.<br><br>
        Now, don't think we forgot the gameplay : you'll find completely redesigned physics too, and maybe you'll be happy to know that every ninja can jump on water again. We hope you'll notice the many optimizations on network games.
        <br><br>
        To play now and discover all these improvements, <a href="%autologin%" target="_blank" style="color:blue; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color:blue;">follow this personal link</span></a> that will log you directly to your account.
